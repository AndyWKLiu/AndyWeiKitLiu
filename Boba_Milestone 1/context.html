                <strong>What is boba?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Boba is a tea-based drink that originated in Taiwan in the early 1980s. It most commonly consists of tea accompanied by chewy tapioca balls, but it can be made with other toppings as well.

                <strong>What can boba do to you?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>1)Apart from caffeine, boba tea contains simple carbohydrate sugar that the body breaks down and converts to energy. This means boba tea can provide temporary energy to keep you boosted all day.</br>
                <br>2)Is it bad to eat boba everyday? Sugar content, simple carbohydrates, and a lack of nutrients might be the least of your concerns if you drink bubble tea every day. Some experts believe that the tapioca balls in bubble tea could contain "cancer-causing chemicals,"</br>
                <br>3)The tapioca balls and sweetened drinks, when consumed too often, can cause major health problems. One boba, milk tea with pearls, can have 36 grams of sugar â€” as much as a can of soda. It's something public health advocates say too many people don't realize.</br>
